# Guess A Number
This is a practice project, a C# console app, for guessing a randomly generated number.

The application will generate a random number between 0 and 100. The user will have to guess that number. If the guess matches, the application will exit displaying a message that the guess was correct. Otherwise, a message will be shown letting the user know if the number (s)he guessed was lower or higher than the application generated random number. The application continues until and unless the user guesses the number correctly.
